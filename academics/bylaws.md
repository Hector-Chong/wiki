# Regulations for first-entry undergraduate programs

**1.1** All courses shall have some type of non-optional, meaningful, final examination during the examination period.

**1.2** Two to three-hour examination slots will normally be scheduled in the formal final examination periods in each
semester for all courses which terminate in that semester. All final examinations shall take place (or fall due, as the case may be) during the two to three-hour final examination slot so scheduled. Asynchronous online examinations must commence or end within the scheduled time slot. The actual duration of testing procedures during the scheduled final examination slot may be less than the scheduled time, at the discretion of the individual instructor.

If oral or other special types of examinations cannot be accommodated in the two to three-hour final examination slot, and satisfactory arrangements cannot be made with the course instructor, notice will be given to the Registrar by the AAU Head and special arrangements will be made.

**1.3** The last seven calendar days prior to, and including, the last day of classes in each period of instruction of
twelve (or greater) weeks in duration must be free from any procedures for which a mark will be assigned, including the submission of assignments such as essays, term papers, and take home examinations. Courses that are presented by a specialized teaching method, where the testing procedures are an integral part of the instructional process, shall be exempt from this regulation subject to approval of the Dean of the Faculty in which the course is given.

-   **1.3.1** In the case of periods of instruction of eight-eleven weeks in duration, clause 1.3 shall apply to the last four calendar days before the start of the examination period;

**2.4** The procedures for the grading of class participation should be clearly stated to students in the written
information specifying the procedures for the determination of final grades.
